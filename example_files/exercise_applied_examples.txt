1. Find the numbers of species belonging to genus “Vibrio” in file proks.txt using wildcard.
Note: Bacterial names are mentioned in format genus_species_strain_info.

2. Clean the file proks.txt such that the Organism name includes only entries with genus and species names and no stain information.

3. Convert Organism_groups in file proks.txt as shown below-

From: 
Organism_Name	Organism_Groups	BioProject	Assembly	Size(Mb)	GC%
Pseudomonas_fluorescens	Bacteria;Proteobacteria;Gammaproteobacteria	PRJEB6403	GCA_900475215.1	6.51517	60

To:
Organism_name	Class	Phylum
Pseudomonas_fluorescens	Gammaproteobacteria	Proteobacteria


4. Extract all ids from assembly column which do not contain PRJNA using alternatine matching
